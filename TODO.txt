- gridpanel has wierd collisions on x axis with oter points when dragging
- selected point is not properly updated from table -> grid panel

- zoom feature for grid panel
- order values alpabetically for discrete MappingValues
- order in global list display (what does that mean???)
- search for any type in global list
    - search bar only matches macro names, not action names

- investigate: sometimes saveing/loading doesnt seem  to work?
- tooltip for Mappin gText table, explanation for each value
    "for height=50, take the existing value of pine and multiply it with 37. apply the result to the map"
